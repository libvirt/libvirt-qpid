TODO: 

- Not sure on camel case or underscores.  Original libvirt API uses
camel case, I went with underscores as I was originally basing it off
the ruby bindings.
- Need rc scripts, daemonization, better reconnect/error handling for
both qpid and libvirt.  I think it should attempt to reconnect until
successful whenever it gets disconnected.  We may need an extra status
property for this state as well.
- Return libvirt error codes?
- Make it less chatty, but log stuff (syslog?)
-
