<h3>What is <span class="style1">libvirt-qpid?</span></h3>

    <p>
libvirt-qpid provides an interface with libvirt using QMF (qpid modeling
framework) which utilizes the AMQP protocol.  The Advanced Message Queuing
Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol providing
reliable transport of messages.
    </p>
    <p>
QMF provides a modeling framework layer on top of qpid (which implements 
AMQP).  This interface allows you to manage hosts, domains, pools etc. as
a set of objects with properties and methods.

<h2><a name="architecture">Architecture</a></h2>

<p>
  libvirt-qpid is an agent that runs on a given host.  It will connect
  to both the local libvirtd and to a qpid broker.  It then queries
  libvirtd every 5 seconds and maintains objects of various classes
  that reflect the activity and configuration of libvirtd.
</p>
<p>
  The classes include the node (the host), domains, storage pools, 
  and storage volumes.  A complete synchronization takes place each
  iteration so that any state changes that happen outside of the
  channel provided by libvirt-qpid will be reflected in the objects
  representing the state.
</p>
<p>
  In addition the libvirt API is implemented for each class and calls
  can be made on any of the objects usin the basic libvirt API (with
  some small differences).
</p>
<p>
  Qpid and QMF then provide reliable messaging of calls (they will queue
  up), pushing of changes to libvirt status, and a centralized view of
  a potentially large array of systems (nodes) running libvirt.  All this
  with a fairly intuitive API.  Note also that searching for specific objects
  can be done through the QMF console API and negates the need for the lookup
  functions in the libvirt API.
