libvirt-qpid provides an interface with libvirt using QMF (qpid modeling
framework) which utilizes the AMQP protocol.  The Advanced Message Queuing
Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol providing
reliable transport of messages.

QMF provides a modeling framework layer on top of qpid (which implements 
AMQP).  This interface allows you to manage hosts, domains, pools etc. as
a set of objects with properties and methods.
